#Repository of JLect's Leaflet-based maps
By: Zachary Read

The following repository contains a number of Leaflet-based and OpenStreetMap-based maps used directly or indirectly on JLect.com (https://www.jlect.com). Consequently, most of the maps will be heavily focused on Japonic languages and dialects and other relevant linguistic data.

##Dependencies

These maps are reliant upon the open-sourced JavaScript library Leaflet (http://leafletjs.com/), whose underlying maps are taken from OpenStreetMap (http://openstreetmap.org/).

##Useful links

* Leaflet documentation: http://leafletjs.com/reference.html
* Geojson.io – a tool that helps generate and edit GeoJSON data: http://geojson.io/
